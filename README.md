# course-repos

A repository of links to course repos that are publicly available on GitHub.

Please make Pull-requests to suggest other public courses that we can look at. Our goal is to get a sense of what people have already done and kinds of problems/features/experiences/etc. we should be thinking about.

If the course has a public facing side, you may include that too. However, please do include a direct link to the GitHub!
